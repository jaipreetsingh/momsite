Moorni welcomes you to a peaceful, picturesque hill station where life comes alive in nature's bossom. At an altitude of 1220 msl, King Bhupinder Singh named this serene hill after his queen Morni. The hill station intoxicates anybody with its scenic beauty and cool climate. It's quaint appeal lies in the untouched forest range and the abundance of migratory birds stopping over at the beautiful Tikkar Tal lake which lies at the bottom of the hill. The beautiful hillocks around are lined with cobbled roads, quaint shops, gabled houses and charming facades with scores of fragrant gardens and orchards
